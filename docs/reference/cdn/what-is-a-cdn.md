# What is a CDN?

A CDN is a geographically distributed group of server to quickly serve content at the edge.

## Konfig's CDN

Konfig's CDN geolocates your store's payload as close to your player's as
possible. This makes your stores fast regardless of where your player is
located. Here is an example query to Konfig's CDN:
`https://cdn.konfigthis.com/?env=Development&space=1`.

### Platform Agnostic

Konfig's is platform agnostic as it can server data to any client whether it's Browser, Android, or iOS.
