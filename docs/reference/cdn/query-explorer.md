# Query Explorer

Konfig's dashboard has a query explorer that makes it easy to test your Space's
endpoint. The explorer automatically generates the URL based on the parameters
you provide.

## How to Use

On the left-hand side you can enter parameters you want to use to test your
space. By default the `env` and `space` parameters are filled in for you. Notice
that the query explorer also generates parameters for any fields you setup in
your Player Type [(tutorial here)](/tutorials/set-up-segmentation).
