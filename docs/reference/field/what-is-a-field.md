# What is a Field?

A field is [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) for Type that
describes what data the Type accepts. In otherwords they are the key-value pair of
**Name** and [Field Type](/category/field-types). Konfig uses Fields to validate data for the Dev and generate input forms for the LOM.
