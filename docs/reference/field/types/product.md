# Product Field

A product field is used to link an offer to a pre-approved IAP from the iOS or
Google Play stores. Konfig recommends that you get dummy IAPs approved by Apple
and Google at all price points you are even considering using in a game and then
configuring the Product IDs in Konfig `[WIP]`. This will allow you to
push offers from the server instead of having to do a client update that
requires iOS / Google Play approval.
