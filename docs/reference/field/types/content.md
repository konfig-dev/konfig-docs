# Content Field
A content field is used to configure a reference to an existing piece of content in your game like an item or a character.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Items** for rewards
2. **Currency** for a gacha or conversion product
3. Setting **Character restrictions** in PvP or PvE

## Important Considerations

- We allow you to specify which items are allowed in a field. For example, you might only want items and currencies to be possible rewards in a transaction product and not player experience.
- Items must be configured in the **Content** section before they can be referenced in a content field.
- Use a content field if you want to refer to only 1 item and use a content group if you want to refer to a group of items.
