# What is Segmentation?

Segmentation allows a game to target SKUs and other live events to specific user profiles. A key strategy in modern live ops is to surface the right offer to the right person at the right time in order to maximize conversion and revenue. For example, a player with a $20 LTV is not likely to buy an IAP with a $99.99 price point and even seeing an offer at that price point could be a major turn off for the player. In this case, you can use Konfig's segmentation builder so that only players with $1,000+ LTV and with an average transaction size of over $20 sees offers at the $99.99 price point and for the $20 LTV player to see an offer at a $4.99 price point.
