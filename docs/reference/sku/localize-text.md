# Localizing Text
Konfig allows you to localize any text string in your game using a third party service like [LocalizeDirect](https://www.localizedirect.com/).

# How to Localize Text
Once you have set up your external dictionary, configure a text field in Konfig and input the text string variable from the external dictionary as a value. Then configure your client to make `GET` request to your external dictionary with the text string variable as the key.
