# Scheduling
Konfig's schedule view allows you to see what offers ran in the past and what offers are scheduled to run in the future. You can use it to plan your offers or QA offers directly from the Admin Portal.

1. Click on the **SKU** section and then click on the **Schedule** button

2. The **Schedule** pulls all saved offers that are scheduled to run and displays what offers are running on what day in a **Calendar** view.

3. If you want more information on an offer in the calendar, click on the **Offer Name** and you will be taken directly to the **SKU** page.

4. On the **SKU** page, you can check to make sure it's the offer that you wanted to run on that day and if not, make any edits you need.
