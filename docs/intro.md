Konfig creates SDKs for API developers to make it easy for their customers to
integrate their API. We do this by taking your OpenAPI spec and generating SDKs
in the most popular languages.

Today we have a [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli) that can get you
started in minutes but still handle any level of customization that you need
through simple configuration.
