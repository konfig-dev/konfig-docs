# Konfig: The Tutorial

Welcome to Konfig! Konfig is the fastest and easiest way to build an in-game
store. Konfig is designed for speed, flexibility, and reliability. Konfig frees
your engineers from managing a backend, building custom input forms, manually
validating data, and building revenue generating features like user
segmentation. Engineers can think of Konfig as a headless CMS built specifically
for your store. Konfig also saves your Live Ops Manager (LOM) time by giving
them a fast and easy-to-use tool for creating in-app purchases, SKUs, quests, and other live events. Konfig is also where LOMs
and Devs can come together to collaborate on each other's work in a single
interface.

In this tutorial we will go through the entire process of pushing your first
SKU.

:::note Not all parts of the tutorial are completed by the same person
This tutorial covers all steps to create a SKU but in practice no
one person covers all steps. Some parts will completed by a developer and
other parts will be completed by a LOM. Look out for the `[Dev]` and `[LOM]`
tags in the title of the tutorial to see who should complete which step. But
feel free to read the entire tutorial as all steps are easy to
understand!

Lets get started!
